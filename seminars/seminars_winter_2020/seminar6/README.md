# Feedback and Proposed Changes
* One note here, is it confusing that we change from dplyr to base r syntax?
* Silhouette plot brings up a good point, as does AIC BIC curve, in the lectures we present a way to interpret PCA using estimated variance explained etc., but no way to evaluate clustering in k means/medoids case 
* perhaps we split this lecture up into hierarchical, k clustering, and PCA & tSNE
* Changed Reference to old seminar and one to old lecture
