# Feedback and Proposed Changes
* wateRmelon, as well as some of its annotation dependencies, are outdated and no longer are able to be downloaded in R 3.5 or higher, I added some steps to get things working but it might be more useful for someone who works with processing illumination data (or myself) to find/create a tutorial using currently supported/maintained packages
* fixed installation errors
* I created a separate version of the seminar that replaces some functions from wateRmelon with some from lumi and limma, which don't conflict with an updated R install

## UPDATE
* I swapped some functions from wateRmelon with some from lumi and limma, which appear to be supported still, and appear not to conflict with updated R the seminar runs the same as before
