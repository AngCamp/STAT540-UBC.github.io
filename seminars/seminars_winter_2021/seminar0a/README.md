# Feedback and Proposed Changes

# Evaluating Getting Started Document
## Installation of Rstudio
* Consider installing R and R studio via Anaconda
  This would give the student a way to incorporate new packages that may be required outside of the CRAN repository. Many popular R packages use C or python libraries of a particular version, and installing those manually may results in headaches or further issues
* Install link for Rstudio has changed

# Evaluating getting started with R R-Markdown Document

### Code chunks
* looking at the differences between  `echo=TRUE` and `echo=FALSE` could be confusing if following along from the rmd and not from the pdf

### libraries
* geometry is loaded by default if you use anaconda to install `rstudio` and `r-base`


### Paths
* **first major issue** Directories and paths are much different
* Easy way to avoid disconnect between example files and the auto-printed directories by calling commands in windows is to just include in-text code snippets instead of examples
* Added note about windows dirs

### Methods and datatypes

#### datatypes
* noted that integers are within a defined range in R

#### Accessing 2D data 
* included note about indexing lists and columns of data.frames
