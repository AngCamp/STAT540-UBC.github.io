# Feedback and Proposed Changes
There is no seminar 0b information other than a link to a quiz about the molecular biology review. I was unsure whether or not there should be some study materials here. I assume the goal is that the first couple of lectures give enough info that the students will be caught up. Otherwise I assume that the students are supposed to take the quiz Emma Graham wrote and then they will know what's expected.

The link to Emma's Quiz works, I will make sure that instructors still have access to the quiz.
