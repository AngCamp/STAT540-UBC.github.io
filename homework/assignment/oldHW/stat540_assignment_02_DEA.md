Question 5: Evaluating the results
----------------------------------

**5.3**: Effect of age - visualize top differentially expressed genes (2 POINTS)

-   Take the top 50 genes differentially expressed by age and create a heatmap of their expression levels in logCPM. Sort the genes by p-values and group the samples by time point.

**5.4**: Plot three genes where the interaction does matter (1 POINT)

-   Plot the top three genes with the most significant interaction term. Make a scatterplot with log CPM on the y-axis and age on the x-axis. The shape of each point should correspond to the organism part, and the cell type should correspond to the colour. Note: some conditions have multiple samples, so it is best to plot the mean expression of each treatment group.
