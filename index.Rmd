### Major deadlines
```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
assn <- read.csv("course-admin/assn_2021.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content,start, Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))
knitr::kable(assn)
```

### Assignment Timeline

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(timevis))

assignment_data <- read.csv("course-admin/assn_2021.csv",as.is = T,sep = ",")
assignment_data$start <- paste0(assignment_data$start, " 23:59:00")
timevis(assignment_data)
```
