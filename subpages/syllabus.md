### Prerequisites and useful skills

Officially none BUT here in reality ...

**Statistics**: You should have already taken university level introductory statistics course.

**Biology**: 

- No requirements, but you are expected to learn things like the difference between a DNA and RNA and a gene and a genome
- See [Seminar-1c](../seminars/sm01d_biology-intro_2016.pdf) 

**R**: 

- No experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven't taken other courses on R. 
- Start now by installing R and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integrated development environment" (IDE) RStudio! 
- Best set-up: be able to run R on your own computer and bring your own laptop to each seminar.
- If you are new to R, check out [this blog post on getting started with R](http://santina.me/r/2015/12/15/Get-started-with-R.html). 

**Others:** 

- You'll need to know how to use [Git](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/git01_git-install.html) and GitHub. 
- We'll soon learn about [using Rmarkdown](https://stat540-ubc.github.io/seminars/sm02a_rMarkdown.html) to generate reports, and you'll be using that a lot in this course.
