## Land acknowledgement

We respectfully recognize that the University of British Columbia Vancouver campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. In our current virtual learning environment, we are coming together from locations throughout Vancouver, BC, Canada, and the world. Please take a moment to learn about the territory you are occupying by visiting [this interactive indigenous land map](https://native-land.ca/).

## Course communication

In the web-oriented setting, it is vital that we have a dedicated plan for how we will communicate throughout the semester.

**General questions**: We encourage you to use the [course Github Discussion repository](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Discussion) (you will be granted access after we collect your Github user IDs) for posting questions, so that the message can be seen by the entire teaching team, and so that others in the class who might have the same question can learn from responses. You are also welcome to share your input on questions posted by others. Course announcements will also be posted in this repository, so please check it regularly (and/or subscribe to notifications).

**Private matters**: For private matters, please contact the Teaching team by email (listed above).

**Group work**: In your final project teams, we encourage you to make use of the issues feature in your group's project repo. In addition, you are encouraged to meet regularly via a platform of your choice (e.g. Microsoft Teams). Please reach out if you have any questions or challenges in this space.

## Prerequisites and useful skills

This interdisciplinary course requires a broad range of skills at the interface of statistics, molecular biology / genomics, and computing. While you may have some background in one or more of the following areas, you are not expected to be an expert in all. That said, to be successful in the course, you may need to spend a bit more time in the areas that you have less experience in. Although there are no official prerequisites for the course, here is a list of useful skills to bring into the course and/or learn along the way.

**Statistics**: You should have already taken a university level introductory statistics course.

**Biology**: No requirements, but you are expected to learn things like, e.g. the difference between DNA and RNA, and the difference between a gene and a genome. See [Seminar-0c](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/raw/master/seminars/seminars_legacy/sm01e_biology-intro-2017.pdf) for some basic introductory material. 

**R**: 

- No experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven't taken other courses on R or used it in your research 
- Start now by installing R and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integrated development environment" (IDE) RStudio! 
- You should be able to run R on your own computer during each seminar
- If you are new to R, check out [this blog post on getting started with R](http://santina.me/r/2015/12/15/Get-started-with-R.html). 

**Other computing tools:** 

- You'll need to learn how to use [Git](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/git01_git-install.html) and GitHub. 
- We'll soon learn about [using Rmarkdown](https://stat540-ubc.github.io/seminars/sm02a_rMarkdown.html) to generate reports, and you'll be using that a lot in this course. 

## Course-level learning objectives

  * Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize genomics data
  * Apply tailored statistical methods to answer questions using high dimensional biological data
  * Make your work reproducible, reusable, and shareable
  * Work with real data in a collaborative model

## Selected topics 

  * Basics of molecular genetics/genomics and data collection assays (methods)
  * Basic probability and math foundations
  * Exploratory data analysis and data quality control
  * Normalization, batch correction
  * Basic statistical inference (“one gene at a time”) – linear models
  * Large-scale inference (“genome-wide”) – multiple testing
  * Analysis of microarray, RNASeq, and epigenetics data
  * Principal Component Analysis and Clustering (unsupervised machine learning)
  * Classification and cross validation (supervised machine learning)
  * Gene set analysis and gene networks
  * Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) 
  * Guest lectures on special topics: Single-cell RNA-seq, Causal Inference in Genomics, & Polygenic Risk Scores and Phenome-Wide Association Studies

## Evaluation

You will have three individual assignments, five seminar submissions, and one group project. Deadlines are all by 11:59 pm (Pacific time) on the due date, and late assignments are penalized 10% per day/partial day.

## Academic Integrity

Not only is academic integrity is essential to the successful functioning of our course, but adopting best practices will benefit you in your research practice. Make sure you understand UBC’s definitions of academic misconduct and its consequences. Policy guidelines can be found [here](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,958).

What does academic integrity look like in this course? 

* **Do your own work**. All individual work that you submit should be completed by you and submitted by you. Do not receive or share completed coursework with students who take the course in another term.

* **Acknowledge others’ ideas**. Scholars build on the work of others, and give credit accordingly. This refers to both outside sources, such as from the literature, and inside sources, such as from your peers.

* **Learn to avoid unintentional plagiarism.** Visit the [Learning Commons’ guide to academic integrity](http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/avoiding-plagiarism/) to help you organize your writing as well as understand how to prevent unintentional plagiarism. 

At any time: if you are unsure if a certain type of assistance is authorized, please ask.  

## Video Etiquette & Privacy

During synchronous lecture and class sessions, please observe the following guidelines to help foster a productive learning environment:

* Please note that synchronous sessions and their recordings will not be made available to anyone outside the course
* If your environment is suitable and you are comfortable doing so, please turn your cameras on
* Please keep your microphone muted when you aren't speaking to minimize background noise 
* Please make use of the chat feature to ask questions or make comments - the TAs will be monitoring this space
