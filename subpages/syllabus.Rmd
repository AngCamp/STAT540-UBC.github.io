### Prerequisites and useful skills

Officially none BUT here in reality ...

**Statistics**: You should have already taken university level introductory statistics course.

**Biology**: 

- No requirements, but you are expected to learn things like the difference between a DNA and RNA and a gene and a genome
- See [Seminar-0c](../seminars/seminars_winters_2019/seminar0c/sm01e_biology-intro-2017.pdf) 

**R**: 

- No experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven't taken other courses on R. 
- Start now by installing R and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integrated development environment" (IDE) RStudio! 
- Best set-up: be able to run R on your own computer and bring your own laptop to each seminar.
- If you are new to R, check out [this blog post on getting started with R](http://santina.me/r/2015/12/15/Get-started-with-R.html). 

**Others:** 

- You'll need to know how to use [Git](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/git01_git-install.html) and GitHub. 
- We'll soon learn about [using Rmarkdown](https://stat540-ubc.github.io/seminars/sm02a_rMarkdown.html) to generate reports, and you'll be using that a lot in this course. 

### Evaluation

Students may ask for extensions with a documented excuse (like: computer caught on fire, sickness). No "I just need more time" extensions.

**Seminar completion (10%)**

- Submit "deliverable" for seminars 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6
- Deliverable must be submitted by the end of the week seminar is completed (leniency will be given for the first 2 weeks of the course)
- 2pts per deliverable 

**Dates:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
assn <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2019.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content, start, Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))
kable(assn %>% filter(Category == "Seminar") %>% select(-Category))
```

**Warm-up Assignment (5%)**

- The assignment is worth 5 points.
- tests basic knowledge of GitHub, R and Rmarkdown
- Late penalty: -1 point per day

**Dates:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
assn <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2019.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content,start,Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))
kable(assn %>% filter(Assignment == "Warm-Up") %>% select(-Category))
```

**Paper critique (5%)**

- Summarize and critique 1 paper - 6 points
- Select, read, summarize and critique [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405555/)
- Instruction on the paper critiques will be posted shortly
- [Paper critique instruction](https://stat540-ubc.github.io/subpages/assignments.html)
- Late penalty: -1 points per day

**Dates:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
assn <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2019.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content,start, Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))
kable(assn %>% filter(Category == "Paper Critique") %>% select(-Category))
```

**Homework (30%)**: 

- The assignment is worth 30 points. 
- Involves detailed analysis of real data using R 

**Dates:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
assn <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2019.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content,start, Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))
kable(assn %>% filter(Category == "Individual Assignment", Assignment != "Warm-Up") %>% select(-Category))
```

- Late penalty: -2.5 points per day

**Group project (50%)**: 

- A data analysis group project that will allow you to apply the techniques covered in class
- Important events: 
    - Pitch your ideas, find an idea, form a 4-5 people group 
    - Finish the initial project proposal
    - Finalize the one page project proposal 
    - Progress report
    - Presentation 
    - GitHub repository
    - Individual report deadline

**Dates:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
assn <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2019.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content,start, Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))
kable(assn %>% filter(Category == "Group Project") %>% select(-Category))
``` 

- Grading and deliverable 
    - Primary deliverable is a presentation. Each student also produces a short report 
    - Planning + project + presentation session - 50 points 
- Tip: try to form a group of diverse talents
