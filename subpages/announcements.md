### Late penalty for homework submission
All the late penalty information is posted along with the assignments in the syllabus page. 

### Accept your invitation to the STAT540 organization
Hi, all. If you did the survey, you should have gotten an email that you have been invited to the STAT540 GitHub organization and that you have a personal repository created for you. That repository is where you'll put all your work and do submission by opening issues in it. 

If you somehow didn't get the email, you can also go to the organization webpage: https://github.com/STAT540-UBC. There should be a button somewhere that says something like "Accept invitation". 

You should see three repos in that page: 

- Discussion - the repo where you can ask questions by opening an issue. 
- Your own repo <zz_lastname_firstname_STAT540_2017> - your own repository, only you and the instructors and TAs can see this. 
- STAT540-UBC.github.io - it's the repo that make the website so it contains all the materials. You can find past lectures in there, too. 

You can now start by putting your work for the warm-up assignment in the repo. 

If you didn't complete the survey, please send one of the TAs an email or let us know during the seminars.
