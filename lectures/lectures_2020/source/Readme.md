# Source files for slides generated with RMarkdown

To compile the lecture slides generated with RMarkdown:

1. Clone this repository (or pull changes if you already cloned an earlier version)
2. Open Rmd from within one of the lecture subfolders using RStudio
3. Click 'knit'

If you would like to reproduce the pdf file, you can run `pagedown::chrome_print` on the html file
